# Tony Young 👋

I’m a UK-based software engineering manager and web developer who loves building clean, useful products with great UX. I work mainly with JavaScript/TypeScript and ship end-to-end apps using modern web tooling.

---

## 🚀 Highlights
- Engineering Manager @ DT (post-acquisition from Cado Security)
- Building SaaS products on the side (shipping MVPs fast, then refining)
- Strong focus on developer experience, testing, and maintainable systems
- Interested in psychology + human behaviour (and how tech can support people)
- Always experimenting with new ideas, tools, and workflows

---

## 🔥 What I’m working on right now
- **WeddedTogether** — a wedding guest media sharing app for couples (Next.js + Supabase)
- **EvenGround** — a co-parenting schedule + calendar sync tool (web first, Expo later)
- **Home lab / NAS projects** — self-hosting, automation, and local services

## ✍️ Notes
I like building products that feel calm, intuitive, and genuinely helpful — not just “features for the sake of it”.

Thanks for stopping by 👊
